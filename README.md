## ðŸŽ¯ Project Highlights

### ðŸ”§ Data Engineering & Preprocessing
- Cleaned messy and inconsistent data  
- Handled missing values with imputation  
- Feature engineering: extracted metrics from categorical and numerical data  
- Built structured pipeline for statistical analysis  

### ðŸ“ˆ Key Data-Driven Insights
- *Platform Performance:* Swiggy Instamart emerged as the *fastest delivery platform*  
- *Refunds:* Orders with delays had a *45.6% refund rate*  
- *Order Value Impact:* High-value orders generally received *better service ratings*  
- *Customer Satisfaction:* ~45% of customers gave *positive feedback* (ratings â‰¥ 4)  
- *Category Challenges:* Grocery faced the *most delivery issues*, requiring supply chain improvements

## âœ… Conclusion
- Fast delivery is the *strongest driver of customer satisfaction*  
- Delivery delays significantly increase *refund requests*  
- High-value orders usually receive *better ratings*, but service quality must be consistent  
- Grocery orders need *supply chain optimization*
